# Explanation C-Homework-3

I have more detailed explenation and report given in assignment-3 folder, but to summarize and describe what the instructions and homework were, decided to add
a little file.

The first task was a famous dining philosophers problem that had deadlock and needed fixing, so that every philosopher could eat, not starve and therefore, for
the code to not cause any deadlock.

Second task was focusing on parallelizing Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Final task was about concurrent data structures, in this case, sorted list, that needed proper synchronization. I had implemented both, fine-grained and
coarse grained-locking synchronization mechanisms and compared it to the thread-safe versions of the sorted list.
